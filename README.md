jQuery-Selectmenu
=================

This widget is not a replacement for the selectmenu, it's purpose is to simply add a pretty shell to it.

## Installation

```
npm install
bower install
grunt build-dev
```
This will install the required Node modules (via NPM) and execute the build task (via Grunt).  The grunt task will compile the compass files into css.
